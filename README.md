# Project2

In this project I seek to develop a machine learning model that can predict an employees salary. Unfortunately after much tuning and trying multiple different models I was unable to get R socres over 0.52
The Ridge model was the final selection at this point. I hope to continue to tune and get better with this model.
I will revist and continue to tune.
