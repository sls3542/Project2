# Project2

In this project I seek to develop a machine learning model that can predict an employees salary. Using only work experience data and job title the model was able to with a high degree of accuaracy predict an employees salary.

Its final R2 score was .99 on the Test set and .97 on the train set. This is a functional model and can with a high degree of certainty predict an employees salary. It can be useful for a company in that they could import a persons experience level and job title and generate a potential salary for a new employee.
