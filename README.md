# Project2

In this project I seek to develop a machine learning model that can predict an employees salary. Using only work experience data and job title the model was able to with a high degree of accuaracy predict an employees salary. This regression model was able to be tuned to get an accuarate salary.

This graphic shows that the United States Dollar and the Swiss Franc are the strongest currencies to get paid in.

Unsurprisingly executive level employees are paid the most.

Its final R2 score was .99 on the test set and .97 on the train set. This is a functional model and can with a high degree of certainty predict an employees salary. It can be useful for a company in that they could import a persons experience level and job title and generate a potential salary for a new employee. This is very helpful in the HR department and most likely could be expanded to other jobs with additional data for other jobs.
