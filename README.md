# Project2

In this project I seek to develop a machine learning model that can predict an employees salary. Using only work experience data and job title the model was able to with a high degree of accuaracy predict an employees salary. This regression model will be tuned to get an accuarate salary.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle and was authored by BrianB. It can be found here:

This graphic shows that the United States Dollar and the Swiss Franc are the strongest currencies to get paid in.

Unsurprisingly executive level employees are paid the most.

Its final R2 score was .61 on the test set and .50 on the train set. This model still requires aditional tuning and it is unclear if it can be further manipulated to give better results. The dataset itself is somewhat small. It would be interesting to add more data and see if the number can be raised. All in all I enjoyed working with this data set.
